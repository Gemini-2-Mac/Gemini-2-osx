## What is Gemini 2?  

**Gemini 2** is a smart and efficient **duplicate file management tool** developed to keep your system tidy and optimized. It automatically detects identical and similar files throughout your storage, including photos, videos, music, and documents, helping you free up space while maintaining full control over what’s deleted.  

The app uses advanced **content recognition algorithms** that go beyond simple filename comparison — it recognizes duplicates even if files have been renamed or slightly modified. With its built-in preview window, you can inspect items before removal and restore them if needed.  

Gemini 2 features an adaptive **Smart Cleanup mode** that analyzes your cleanup preferences and learns from your previous actions to make future sessions faster and more accurate. It supports internal drives, network folders, and external storage devices, scanning them all within seconds.  

Built for high performance, Gemini 2 runs smoothly on modern hardware, ensuring quick processing and accurate results. Its clean, minimal interface makes file organization effortless — ideal for users who want to maintain a lean, clutter-free workspace without risking important data.
